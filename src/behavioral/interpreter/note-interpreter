Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter 
that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

The Interpreter pattern is known as abehavioural pattern, as it's used to manage algorithms, 
relationships and responsibilities between objects..

Example
The Interpreter pattern defines a grammatical representation for a language and an interpreter to interpret the grammar.


 
 There are three notations to a mathematical expression i.e. infix, postfix, and prefix.
 
 Infix notation is the common arithmetic and logical formula notation, in which operators are written infix-style between the operands they act on e.g. 3+4.
 
 A postfix a.k.a. Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands e.g. 34+.
 
 Prefix (Polish notation) is a form of notation for logic, arithmetic, and algebra in which operators to the left of their operands e.g. +34.
