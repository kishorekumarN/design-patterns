Visitor pattern is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects. 
With the help of visitor pattern, we can move the operational logic from the objects to another class.

Execution algorithm of element can vary as and when visitor varies.
As per the pattern, element object has to accept the visitor object so that visitor object handles the operation on the element object.

Visitor Pattern Benefits

The benefit of this pattern is that if the logic of operation changes, 
then we need to make change only in the visitor implementation rather than doing it in all the item classes.

Another benefit is that adding a new item to the system is easy, 
it will require change only in visitor interface and implementation and existing item classes will not be affected.
