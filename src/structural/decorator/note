The concept of a decorator is that it adds additional attributes to an object dynamically.
it's used to form large object structures across many disparate objects. 

Allows for the dynamic wrapping of objects in order to modify their existing responsibilities and behaviours

Would I Use This Pattern?
The Decorator pattern should be used when:
1. Object responsibilities and behaviors should be dynamically modifiable
2. Concrete implementations should be decoupled from responsibilities and behaviors
